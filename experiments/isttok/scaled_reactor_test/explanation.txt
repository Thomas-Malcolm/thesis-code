Wang requires that x0 >> 1, otherwise with errors up to (1/x0^2). As such, have 
tried "scaling" the reactor. Here we simply blow up the reactor to be large, and shift
the data to be aligned with the new major radius, but leave its minor radius unchanged. 
This seems to be an ok approximation, though further investigation needed.
